# DeepFakeMe

In this notebook, I deepfaked myself by adapting from a demonstration from the paper *First Order Motion Model for Image Animation*. You can find more information [here](https://aliaksandrsiarohin.github.io/first-order-model-website/) in their website.

I was inspired from this YouTube video titled *[How It's Memed: First Order Motion Model Deepfake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZr3EHLBm4g&feature=youtu.be)*.

Google Colab demo, from which I adapted and modified from, can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/AliaksandrSiarohin/first-order-model/blob/master/demo.ipynb#scrollTo=SB12II11kF4c). The pre-trained model (which is required but since it's too big thus I excluded it in this repo) can be obtained from this shared Drive [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kZ1gCnpfU0BnpdU47pLM_TQ6RypDDqgw?usp=sharing). Place the `.tar` file in the `first-order-motion-model` directory.

Note that the model is trained on 256\*256 pixel images.
